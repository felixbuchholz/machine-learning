### Machine

- What is a machine? (an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task.)
- What does it actually do?

### Learning

- How does a machine learn?
- From whom? (- Us, data that has been categorized by us)
- With what?
- How does this lead to intelligence?

### Machine Learning

- Problems have to be pretty simple
- Only the aggregation of these simple solutions can solve more complex models then

### Linear Regression is the First Kind of Machine Learning

- It’s like a statistical linear regression to predict things, but the way to get there is totally different approach (breaking statistics)
- Focus on the x side of the equation instead of y (opposite of statistics)

### Trial & Error

- It’s undisciplined disciple.

### Levels of complexity in ml

- Which models should I choose?
- What data?
- How to fine-tune of the parameters?

### Models in ml

- The best model is the one that predicts best, it doesn’t matter if it makes sense.
- Training sets and control sets should be representative.

**“Target function“** – Term for the mathematically perfect function.

### Remarks

- Finding patterns: Sometimes it’s not exactly clear, if the result is adequate. We don’t know what’s right or wrong
- Google Arts & Culture, Self-portrait (match-rate)
