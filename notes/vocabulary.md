# Machine Learning Vocabulary

- clustering: classifying unlabeled data
- unsupervised learning: learning with unlabeled data
- supervised learning: learning with labeled data
- Jaccard coefficient: measure of similarity (shared occurrences / total occurrences)
- Association rules
- matrix decomposition
- accuracy: Splitting the data into a training and a test set
- cross-validation: randomly divide the data in ten parts of equal size, and use nine parts for training and one part for testing. We do this ten times, using each part once for testing. Cross-validation can also be applied to other supervised learning problems, but unsupervised learning methods typically need to be evaluated differently.
